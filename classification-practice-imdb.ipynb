Only saving grace in the movie were the last thirty minutes, which were seriously funny elsewhere the movie fails miserably. First half was desperately been tried to look funny but wasn't. Next 45 minutes were emotional and looked totally artificial and illogical.<br /><br />OK, when you are out for a movie like this you don't expect much logic but all the flaws tend to appear when you don't enjoy the movie and thats the case with Heyy Babyy. Acting is good but thats not enough to keep one interested.<br /><br />For the positives, you can take hot actresses, last 30 minutes, some comic scenes, good acting by the lead cast and the baby. Only problem is that these things do not come together properly to make a good movie.<br /><br />Anyways, I read somewhere that It isn't a copy of Three men and a baby but I think it would have been better if it was.\"\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_train[1] # плохой отзыв","execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":32,"data":{"text/plain":"2"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text_train[2]","execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":33,"data":{"text/plain":"b'The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a \"Whodunnit?\" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the \"sick sticks\" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_train[2] # хороший отзыв","execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":34,"data":{"text/plain":"2"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Простой подсчет слов\n#Составим словарь всех слов с помощью CountVectorizer.\n\ncv = CountVectorizer()\ncv.fit(text_train)\n\nlen(cv.vocabulary_)","execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":35,"data":{"text/plain":"124255"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Посмотрим на примеры полученных \"слов\" (лучше их называть токенами).
